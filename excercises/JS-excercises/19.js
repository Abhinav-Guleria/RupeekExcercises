//19 Create 2 objects (that represents 2 persons, say John and Jane), each with 2 properties - name (a string), and age (a number).
/* Print John's age.
* Increase Jane's age and print the Jane object.
* Add an address property to John and set it to an object with "first line" and "city" as properties (the values for these properties also need to be set).
* Print John's city name

* Add a new property spouse to each object. Set John's spouse property to Jane object, and Jane's spouse property to John object
* Add an emailids property to Jane. Set it to an array with 2 strings representing Jane's email ids. * Print the second email id of Jane.
* Change the second email id of Jane and print it.
* Add a third email id for Jane and print the Jane object.
* Add a method celebrateBirthday() on John that adds 1 to the John's age. Call it on John to increase John's age.
* Add a method celebrateBirthday() on Jane that adds 1 to the Jane's age. Call it on Jane to increase Jane's age.
* Wouldn't it be nice to have a single celebrateBirthday() method shared by both John and Jane objects? Declare celebrateBirthday() as a global function and set it up as a method on both John and Jane objects. Call it to check it increases the age.
